"""Post-codegen patch: make every statically-unresolved guest branch/call dispatch
instead of aborting.

RexGlue codegen gives up in two places:

1. bctr jump tables it under-counts. It emits
   `default: __builtin_trap(); // Switch case out of range`
   (manual [[entrypoint.switch_tables]] are parsed but never applied in SDK
   0.10.0.9-dev, measured 2026-09-24: "Loaded manual switch table" at debug
   level, "discoverBlocks: using manual jump table" never emitted). Every such
   switch is preceded by `mtctr rN` -> `ctx.ctr.u64 = ...` computed from the
   real guest table, so ctx.ctr already holds the correct target for ANY index:
   REX_CALL_INDIRECT_FUNC(ctx.ctr.u32) restores guest semantics, and an unknown
   target becomes a harvestable FATAL log instead of SIGILL.

2. Branch/call targets it never discovered: REX_FATAL("Unresolved branch|call
   from 0xS to 0xT"). REX_FATAL is log+std::abort, i.e. a silent-ish process
   death (0xC0000409) that costs one build+launch cycle per address when hunted
   live. This pass rewrites all of them at once:

     * branch whose 0xT label already exists in the SAME generated function body
       -> `goto loc_T`. This is the common case in this title: the block is a
       real intra-function edge that discovery simply failed to link (measured
       2026-09-24: 0x824AF5C0 is `loc_824AF5C0:` at gowj_recomp.123.cpp:5400 and
       simultaneously "conditional branch to unknown address" at :8507 of the
       same function). Correct guest semantics, no new function, no cycle.
     * otherwise -> REX_CALL_INDIRECT_FUNC(0xT); return; using the dispatch
       table plus the runtime resolver.

It prints how many of the rewritten dispatch targets are still not registered in the function table.

Run after every codegen pass, before build. Idempotent. Wired into the build via
CMakeLists.txt (the switchtrap step) - do NOT put it in
generated/rexglue.cmake (codegen re-emits that file from the SDK template).

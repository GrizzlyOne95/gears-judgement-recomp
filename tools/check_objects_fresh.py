"""POST_BUILD guard: prove every patched source was actually compiled.

Why: ninja decides what is dirty when the build is PLANNED, before any of the
post-codegen patcher edges run. So when a patcher rewrites a generated .cpp
during a build whose .obj was already up to date, ninja never queues that
compile, links the stale object, and the shipped exe silently lacks the patch.
Measured 2026-09-25 00:21: patch_raw_look rewrote gowj_recomp.133.cpp at
00:21:49 and gowj.exe linked at 00:21:54 from an object last compiled at the
previous afternoon - a 9-hour-stale TU carrying the entire raw-mouse feature.

The fix is to build twice, which is what scripts/build.ps1 does; this script makes the
first build LOUD instead of quietly wrong. It compares each generated source
against the object CMake names for it and fails if any source is newer.

    python tools/check_objects_fresh.py <gen_dir> <obj_dir>

Exit 0 = every object is at least as new as its source.

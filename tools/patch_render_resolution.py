"""Post-codegen patch: let the HOST choose the guest's render resolution.

WHY THIS EXISTS (all measured, no guessing):

* Gears of War: Judgment allocates its back buffer at 1280x720 no matter what the
  host asks for. `video_mode_width/height` reach the guest (a CLI override shows
  up in the runtime's own `[config]`/`VdQueryVideoMode` path) and the engine still
  creates `tiled 1280x720x1 2D k_8_8_8_8`.
* `draw_resolution_scale_x/y` do NOT add visible pixels: the guest rasterises at
  Nx and then resolves back DOWN into its own fixed-size 720p texture, so the
  monitor only ever receives a 720p image that the host stretches. It also costs
  4-9x the GPU work, which is why "200 fps" felt sluggish.
* The single writer of the engine's two render-size globals is sub_82990A28
  (gowj_recomp.206.cpp). It computes
      height := 720                                  # literal
      width  := clamp(round(aspect * 720.0), 904, 1280)
  and ~40 consumers (the render-target builder, viewports, the present params)
  read those two words back. So the fix is three instructions, not a rewrite.
* ...but it is four, because the same function then second-guesses that decision:
      lwz r11,0(r30)        # r30 == &width global, so this re-reads the store
      cmpwi cr6,r11,1280
      beq   <normal path>
                            # else: a THIRD size global set (base+15872/15876,
                            #  initialised to 1120/688/1344 by sub_82990990 in
                            #  gowj_recomp.120.cpp:17797) is clobbered to
                            #  800x800 plus a flag cleared at base+17496.
  Measured 2026-09-24: overriding the width to 2560/3840 takes that fallback, and
  the frame then appears stacked target_height/720 times - the engine is still
  laying its output out against a size that is no longer the render target. So
  the guard is fed the guest's own pre-override width instead of the stored one:
  the override changes the target, never the engine's standard-resolution verdict.

WHAT IT DOES: routes each site through a host hook so config decides:

    ctx.r11.u32 = GowjGuestRenderHeight(720);
    ctx.r6.u32  = GowjGuestRenderHeight(720);          # the %dx%d log argument
    REX_STORE_U32(..., GowjGuestRenderWidth(ctx.r5.u32));
    ctx.r11.u64 = GowjGuestOriginalWidth(REX_LOAD_U32(ctx.r30.u32 + 0));

The hooks live in src/gowj_render_scale.cpp and return the guest's own value when
gowj_render_width/height are 0, so an unpatched-behaviour default is preserved and
the override is provable: the first substitution logs
`gowj RESSCALE guest width 1280 -> 3840` at WARN level.

Every substitution must land exactly once across the whole tree; main() raises
otherwise. A silent partial patch is precisely the failure mode that let an
earlier build claim a resolution it did not have.

Wired into gowj/CMakeLists.txt as gowj_render_scale_patch, chained AFTER
gowj_switchtrap_patch (both mutate the same files, so they must not race). Never
hook generated/rexglue.cmake - codegen re-emits that file from the SDK template.

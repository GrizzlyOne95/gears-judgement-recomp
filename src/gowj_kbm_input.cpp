// Mouse-look model - TRUE RAW MOUSE, and why.
//
// The guest integrates its camera rotation ONCE PER INPUT POLL from the right-
// stick deflection it read that poll. So the turn a physical mouse movement
// produces is sum(deflection_i * guest_step) over the polls it spans. For that
// sum to equal (mouse distance * gain) - the raw PC contract, where a 2-inch
// movement turns the same angle whether the machine runs 30 or 300 fps and
// whether the hand moved slowly or flicked - the delivered deflections must
// account for every pixel, with no time term and no lost remainder.
//
// That is what the stick-unit debt in GetDeviceState does. The earlier model
// here mapped deflection proportionally to one poll's pixels and clamped it,
// which silently deleted the over-range part of every fast flick: slow drags
// and hard flicks turned different angles for the same distance. Before that,
// a velocity model (pixels/dt) made the turn frame-rate coupled, which is the
// "mouse feels even worse with unlocked fps" report.
//
// Momentum: none. The debt is paid out in full to within half a stick unit, so
// the frame the hand stops the deflection is 0. The retired "ice slide" came
// from an old decay timer draining past motion into later frames, not from
// carrying a debt.

// is [-1, 1] - and arg2 = the frame's dt, and the frame's turn is arg1 * arg2. The

// struct (stfs f31,92(r1) / stfs f30,96(r1)) and re-issues that struct to every
// bound handler, so both are live numbers with their own meaning downstream: arg1
// saturates at +/-1 and arg2 is the integration step anything time-based in the
// handler will use.
//
// WHY THE HYBRID. Mode 0 (adding the angle to arg1) is exact for small moves and
// silently throws away everything above full deflection, so a fast flick turns the
// same angle as a slow one - the player's "it acts exactly like emulating a
// joystick should, especially with fast flicks that it can't handle". Mode 1 is
// exact always, but it does that by lying about dt on every single call: a 1-pixel
// nudge asked the engine for a 0.0003 s frame and a hard flick for a 1.8 s one, so
// every time-based term downstream of this call ran at the wrong step - which is
// "too sensitive and slidey". The hybrid takes the loss only where a loss is
// unavoidable: while the demanded turn fits inside one real frame it goes through
// as an honest analog deflection with the real dt untouched, and only a flick that
// outruns the engine's own maximum turn rate spills into the time argument, because
// "faster than max rate" cannot be expressed any other way in a rate channel.
//
